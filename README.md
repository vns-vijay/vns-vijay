### Hi, I'm Vijay Sharma ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

Iâ€™m a Data Scientist specializing in **Operations Research**, with a passion for solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches. With a background in optimization techniques, I focus on improving business processes and decision-making using mathematical models and algorithms. 

I have experince in supply chain domain and have solved real world problems which includes network optimization, vehicle routing problem, warehouse slotting, pick scheduling, pick path optimization etc. 

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate on interesting data science projects or just want to chat about the latest trends in tech!

ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about**:  
- Operations Research (Optimization, LP, MILP, Discrete Event Optimization)  
- Data Science tools & techniques (Python, PuLP, scikit-learn, TensorFlow)  
- Building efficient algorithms for large-scale data problems

ðŸ”­ **Currently working on**:  
- Developing mathematical optimzation models for retail warehouse operations  
- Exploring reinforcement learning for dynamic pricing strategies

âš¡ **Fun fact**:  
- When Iâ€™m not analyzing data, I enjoy reading books
